# Introduction

I find reading through open source projects particularly hard to understand. Especially when the architecture is implemented using advanced features of a particular language or some obscure library. 
This is an attempt to make my life easier by experimenting with LLMs to see if I can develop understandings of open source projects that I might be interested in.
